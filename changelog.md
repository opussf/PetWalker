## PetWalker â€“ Changes

### 1.1.1 (2022-09-25)
- Fix for Brewfest: No pet summoning allowed while we are riding a Ram for the daily quests
    - Summoning attempts could cancel the Ram aura (43880 and 43883)

### 1.1.0 (2022-08-24)
- Squished `/pw n` bug
- Help and Status message (`/pw h` and `/pw s`): added examples, fixed punctuation; split into chunks for better scrolling.
- Added many infos to the ReadMe.
- New setting: verbosity level for messages:
    - `/pw v`: silent; only important messages (missing favorites, failed summons, etc.) are printed to chat.
    - `/pw vv`: medium; message when a new pet is summoned.
    - `/pw vvv`: full; all messages, also when a lost pet is restored, which happens quite often.
